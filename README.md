# commandMe

**currently in development**

* A business communication platform that functions based on 'commands'.
* For those in senior positions, distributing tasks will be simple and clear. The 'commander' of a task will be notified once when the task is confirmed and when the task is submitted. Seniors will be able to review the task and provide feedback directly on the thread.
* For Juniors, tasks will be organized according to a customizable filter. Once you confirm a request, they will be added to your to-do list according to the respective due-dates. Not only will this be a communications platform for your team, but also a personal task manager.
